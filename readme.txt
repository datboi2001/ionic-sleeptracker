2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
~15 hours


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
N/A


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
N/A


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
N/A


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We designed our app to be accessible for a daily user, and included monthly analysis for them to use to improve their sleep.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
Our app was designed for both, but has qualities that are more suited for Android.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A person can log their sleep by inputting the start time and end time, and submitting that as a sleep log. We also allowed for the sleeper to log naps the same way, as a person sleep obtained from naps might increase the total duration of sleep a person was getting, and would be a nice additional feature for a sleep tracking app.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A person logs sleepiness during the day by selecting a number to represent the magnitude of sleepiness they are feeling and the time of day they felt that sleepiness. We integrated error checks to prevent spamming, but also thought that having a number associated with a timestamp would make the data valuable if the user wanted to trak their sleepiness.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
The person can view their data with two graphs, each representing a summary of the previous month's sleep as well as a small analysis caption to help the person understand their sleep data better. We thought using a month to month data visualization model would give more insight to the user on how their sleep may look like over a slightly longer period of time.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
We chose to back up logged data, having the mobile app store sleep log data in local storage.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N/A


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
It backs up to the phone's local storage.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
Our app implements good mobile design by providing a simple, yet effective initial view that leads to the app's core functions. Each of the 3 core components in the app include backtracking to the main page, and each component also has error checking specifically designed to prevent user error and/or malicious input, providing a satisfactory user experience.
